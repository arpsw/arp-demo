- In PHP, use `match` operator over `switch` whenever possible
- Generate Enums always in the folder `app/Enums`, not in the main `app/` folder, unless instructed differently.
- Always use Enum value as the default in the migration if column values are from the enum. Always casts this column to the enum type in the Model.
- Don't create temporary variables like `$currentUser = auth()->user()` if that variable is used only one time.
- Always use Enum where possible instead of hardcoded string values, if Enum class exists. For example, in Blade files, and in the tests when creating data if field is casted to Enum then use that Enum instead of hardcoding the value.

## Laravel instructions
 
- Using Services in Controllers: if Service class is used only in ONE method of Controller, inject it directly into that method with type-hinting. If Service class is used in MULTIPLE methods of Controller, initialize it in Constructor.
- **Eloquent Observers** should be registered in Eloquent Models with PHP Attributes, and not in AppServiceProvider. Example: `#[ObservedBy([UserObserver::class])]` with `use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Attributes\ObservedBy;` on top
- Aim for "slim" Controllers and put larger logic pieces in Service classes
- When writing services, aim for single responsibility, separation of concerns and dependency on abstractions (interfaces) rather than concretions, to allow for easier testing and future flexibility.
- Follow SOLID principles when possible and when it is reasonable. Don't over-engineer, but also don't write yourself into a corner with tightly coupled code.
- When writing Eloquent queries, use `when()` for conditional clauses instead of `if` statements around the query. Example: `User::query()->when($active, fn($q) => $q->where('active', true))->get()`
- Use eager loading (`with()`) to prevent N+1 query problems when accessing relationships in Blade files or in code. Example: `Post::with('author')->get()` if you need to access `$post->author` in the Blade file.
- Use Laravel helpers instead of `use` section classes. Examples: use `auth()->id()` instead of `Auth::id()` and adding `Auth` in the `use` section. Other examples: use `redirect()->route()` instead of `Redirect::route()`, or `str()->slug()` instead of `Str::slug()`.
- Don't use `whereKey()` or `whereKeyNot()`, use specific fields like `id`. Example: instead of `->whereKeyNot($currentUser->getKey())`, use `->where('id', '!=', $currentUser->id)`.
- Don't add `::query()` when running Eloquent `create()` statements. Example: instead of `User::query()->create()`, use `User::create()`.
- In Livewire projects, don't use Livewire Volt. Only Livewire class components.
- When adding columns in a migration, update the model's `$fillable` array to include those new attributes. Check, if that requires adding new casts or relationships to the model as well.
- Never chain multiple migration-creating commands (e.g., `make:model -m`, `make:migration`) with `&&` or `;` — they may get identical timestamps. Run each command separately and wait for completion before running the next.
- Always use FormRequest classes for validating form data and authorizing form actions, instead of validating directly in Controllers or Livewire components. This keeps validation logic organized and reusable.
- Controllers: Single-method Controllers should use `__invoke()`; multi-method RESTful controllers should use `Route::resource()->only([])`
- In Blade files always use `@selected()` and `@checked()` directives instead of `selected` and `checked` HTML attributes. Good example: @selected(old('status') === App\Enums\ProjectStatus::Pending->value). Bad example: {{ old('status') === App\Enums\ProjectStatus::Pending->value ? 'selected' : '' }}.

## Testing instructions
 
### Before Writing Tests
 
  1. **Check database schema** - Explore the relevant Eloquent Model and its migration to understand:
     - Which columns have defaults
     - Which columns are nullable
     - Foreign key relationship names
 
  2. **Verify relationship names** - Read the model file to confirm:
     - Exact relationship method names (not assumed from column names)
     - Return types and related models
 
  3. **Test realistic states** - Don't assume:
     - Empty model = all nulls (check for defaults)
     - `user_id` foreign key = `user()` relationship (could be `author()`, `employer()`, etc.)
